Cyclical Calendar
=================
Cyclical Calendar is a calendar for things you want to do periodically but not on specific dates like getting your hair cut or watering the plants.  

Currently, this is just a prototype to demonstrate that we can render the basic UI using d3.js and SVG.  To see what it looks like, [download the project](https://github.com/ctcutler/cyclical/archive/master.zip) and load cyclical.html in Google Chrome (other web browsers are untested but may also work).  

This list of use cases will guide the UI design and feature development:
* remind myself to do something every N hours/days/weeks/months/years
* see things that are due now
* see things that are due soon
* see all things in calendar
* mark something done (reset it)
* add something
* edit something
* remove something
* adjust where something is in its cycle
